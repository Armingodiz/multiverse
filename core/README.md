# Service boilerplate


## Getting started



    Application_name is the name of your service(application) which needs to be replaced in certain files and also in import path of each package.

Files you need to check: `config.go, .env.dev, makefile, go.mod, DockerFile, docker-compose.yml, DockerFile.dev and every other import path.`

** Remmeber you can use shortend version of your application name in config.go and env.dev(they must be equal)
